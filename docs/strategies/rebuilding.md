# Rebuilding Chroma DB

## Rebuilding a Collection

Here are several reasons you might want to rebuild a collection:

- Your metadata or binary index is corrupted or even deleted
- Optimize performance of HNSW index after a large number of updates

!!! danger "WAL Consistency and Backups"

    Before you proceed, make sure to backup your data. Secondly make sure that your WAL contains all the data to allow 
    the proper rebuilding of the collection. For instance, after v0.4.22 you should not have run optimizations or WAL 
    cleanup.

!!! warn "IMPORTANT"

    Only do this on a stopped Chroma instance.

Find the UUID of the target binary index directory to remove. Typically, the binary index directory is located in the
persistent directory and is named after the collection vector segment (in `segments` table). You can find the UUID by
running the following SQL query:

```bash
sqlite3 /path/to/db/chroma.sqlite3 "select s.id, c.name from segments s join collections c on  s.collection=c.id where s.scope='VECTOR';"
```

The above should print UUID dir and collection names.

Once you remove/rename the UUID dir, restart Chroma and query your collection like so:

import chromadb
client = chromadb.HttpClient() # Adjust as per your client
res = client.get_collection("my_collection").get(limit=1,include=['embeddings'])

Your collection will be recreated.

!!! note "Rebuilding the collection"

    Depending on how large your collection is, this process can take a while.
