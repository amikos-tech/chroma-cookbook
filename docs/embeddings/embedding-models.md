# Embedding Models

!!! note "Work in Progress"
    This page is a work in progress.

Embedding Models are your best friends in the world of Chroma, and vector databases in general. They take something you
understand in the form of text, images, audio etc. and turn it into a list of numbers (embeddings), which a machine learning
model can understand. This process makes documents interpretable by a machine learning model.
